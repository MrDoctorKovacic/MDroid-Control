# MDroidControl

Android app to control my car. Sends requests to and from [MDroid-Core](https://github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/MDroid-Core). The controls from the settings page are currently placeholders, but everything else is fully functional.

Only tested on Android, iOS likely won't build.

`npm install && react-native run-android`
